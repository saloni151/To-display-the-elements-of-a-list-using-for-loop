# Display Elements of a List Using a for Loop

- This Python script demonstrates how to iterate over a list and display each of its elements using a for loop.

# What This Program Does

- Creates a list containing mixed data types (integer, float, string).

- Uses a for loop to access and print each element in the list.


# Explanation

- The list l contains 5 elements: 5, 65.5, 32, 55, and "Python".

- The for loop runs once for each element in the list.

- On each iteration, the current element is stored in the variable elements and printed.

# Learning Points
- Python lists can hold different data types.

- A for loop can directly iterate through the elements of a list without using indexing.

- This is a simple and clean way to process each item in a sequence.
